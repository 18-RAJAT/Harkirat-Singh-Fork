In this lecture we will learn more about dynamic backend authentication using Express JWT and MongoDB

Let us start by recalling what we have done so far. Till now we have either used postman or used the browser URL to send a get request to an HTTP server. But we haven't done that like in chatGPT when we click a button like enter button after writing the prompt, a request goes out and the backend gets trigged which then fetches the response. Thankfully the browsers provide you a function to do this which is part of the javascript runtime(not ECMAscript but was created by browser creators). This specific function is called fetch.

So now we are going to use this third way to send a request.
Let us say we have to create an HTML page where-
1. User can see names of 10 people
2. You need to make sure you get these data from an API call

For this we are going to use a sample API https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons

Whenever we put this URL on the browser and inspect, we can see that we get a response in network-headers which has all the data.
This response is an object that has data as an array which has 10 different values, all of these values are objects containing the persons name address birthday etc
